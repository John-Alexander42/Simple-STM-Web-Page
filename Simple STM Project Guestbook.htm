<CENTER>Welcome to my project guest book! I was curious about all the traffic on my 
web site so I have added this guest book.

I finally got to Jurgen Muller's site tonight after many links had failed in previous sessions, and then from his site to your's. I've been facinated by home-made STMs since I came across a short reference to Russell's course an a mention of a unit "built with Radio Shack parts" over a year ago.

Russell did not respond to my e-mails.  I found Jim Rice's homebrew pages, but they don't begin to tell you how to do it. Tonight I think I've really found the Radio Shack version in your site, and I'm thrilled! 
Thanks very much for your efforts in developing the concept and presenting it in a way that makes me think even a moderately clever tinkerer like myself might be able to have a crack at it.

I'm also excited by Muller's site. I agree with your comment. It is the most complete and accessable amateur STM site I've seen so far.

I'll keep in touch if I get anyplace with this. At the very least I'll have a good time thinking about it. Thanks again, and best wishes.

The homebrew STM is a very impressive concept.
People need to work on this.<BR>

I started electronics construction following seeing your description of your work. I intend to construct your design and see what is possible. So far I have constructed a signal generator and logic probe, and shortly will build a data logger for the syste
. I may also have to build an oscilloscope.I shall follow your work as closely as I can - and if I can construct an SPM anyone can. Best wishes john cookson<BR>

Your idea for the PZT is clever. Have you thought about using e.g. the voice coil lens positioner from a CD player or someway of adapting an old phono cartridge (e.g. the moving magnet type)<BR>

This is a great site, it sure wet my appetite to build one. Though more info. on operating the system would be welcome.<BR>

I am a 4th year electronic engineering student and one of the main requirements of my final year design project, is to build a stm using the Unimorph method. Your web page is extremely useful and very informative however there is still alot of information
which I require. Please send me your email address as soon as possible so that I can email you all my questions pertaining to your design of the STM. Date: 3 July 2000<BR>

Very interesting project.
Here in our lab, we have limited
funds to buy equipment, so I am
always looking for projects like this.
Good luck!

Looking forward to the first images John! Meanwhile, I'm putting together my STM (inspired by yours, but with inertial sample coarse positioning)

Cheers,
Andrew<BR>
