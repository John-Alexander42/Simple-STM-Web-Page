</FONT><P align="CENTER">Inventors: John Alexander, Marco Tortonese, and Thai Nguyen</P>
<P>Abstract:</P>
</B><P>A scanning mechanism is provided for use in a scanning probe microscope. The scanning mechanism includes a stationary portion; a moveable portion; a plurality springs attaching the moveable portion to the fixed portion, the plurality of springs providing tension against movement of the moveable portion relative to the stationary portion, the tension provided by the plurality of springs having a substantially linear spring constant over a scan distance; and one or more voice coils attached to either the moveable portion or the stationary portion for moving the moveable portion relative to the stationary portion in one or more orthogonal directions.</P>

<FONT size="4"><P align="CENTER">US5952657: Atomic force microscope with integrated optics for attachment to optical microscope</P>
</FONT><P align="CENTER">Inventors: John Alexander, Marco Tortonese, and Thai Nguyen</P>
<P>Abstract:</P>
</B><P>Atomic force microscope system is provided which is designed to be incorporated into or attachable to an objective lens which can be mounted on a lens turret of an optical microscope such that simultaneous atomic force microscopy and optical viewing of a sample through the objective lens can be performed. In one embodiment, the atomic force microscope (AFM) is designed to be removably attached to a standard objective lens of an optical microscope. In another embodiment, the AFM system is designed to be removably attached to an optical microscope and includes integrated optics for providing an optical view. In both embodiments, the optics are used solely for generating an optical view and/or other optical contrast mechanisms and are not used in conjunction with a detection mechanism of the AFM.</P>

</FONT><P align="CENTER">Inventors: John D. Alexander, and Michael D. Kirk</P>
</B><P><B>Abstract:</B> </P>
<P>A single-axis active vibration reducing system for reducing vibrations in an object in a single axis. The vibration isolation system enables the sensing of motion of the center of mass of an object along a single axis and, with the proper positioning of a single sensor-actuator pair with feedback operation, the dampening of vibrations of the object along that axis. Due to the positioning and alignment of the actuator, the vibration isolation system of the present invention does not introduce appreciable off-axis vibration. The vibration reducing system includes an actuator positioned on the object to impart an actuation force along an actuator axis to reduce vibrations of the object in the vibrational axis without imparting substantial motion to the object other than in the vibrational axis. </P>

</FONT><P align="CENTER">Inventors: Frederick I. Linker, Michael D. Kirk, John D. Alexander, Sang-il Park,</P>
<P align="CENTER">Sung-il Park, Ian R. Smith</P>
</B><P><B>Abstract:</B> </P>
<P>A scanning probe microscope having numerous advantages is disclosed. Respective scanning force and scanning tunneling probes are removably mounted in the head using kinematic mounting techniques so that they may be substituted for one another without the need to adjust the cantilever deflection sensor. A linear position-sensitive photodetector in the deflection sensor eliminates further the need for adjustments. A motorized, non-stacked x,y coarse movement stage is kinematically positioned with respect to the base and features a minimized mechanical loop to reduce thermal and vibrational effects on the position of the sample. A z coarse movement stage positions the head kinematically with respect to the base and includes a motorized drive means which allows the height, tilt and pitch of the probe to be adjusted. The scanner includes x,y and z sample position detectors which provide an accurate measurement of the position of the sample with respect to the probe. The z position detector provides an output which is exclusive of sample tilt and which may be used as an output of the scanning probe microscope. The outputs of the x,y and z position detectors may also be connected in feedback loops with the controller to improve the performance of the scanning probe microscope. </P>
