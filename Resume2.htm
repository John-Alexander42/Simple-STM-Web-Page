<U><P>Electrical Design Engineer</B></U> for KLA-Tencor March 2000 to July 2003. I started in profilers working on advanced development projects developing electronics for a heterodyne laser interferometer. I was assigned to work on another advanced development project measuring Cu film thickness. We developed a microwave near field Probe to measure Cu thickness using eddy currents. We have got a patent on this technique(US006794886B1). I was next assigned to work on Quantox a Kelvin probe tool. I built a prototype using a Quartz tuning fork probe. This method was promising because no light was required to monitor the motion of the probe. I designed the Probe control board and Pre-amplifier for the new Quantox. The Probe Control Board has two dual channel lockin detectors, twelve 20 bit ADCs, two 24 bit DACs and an Altera EPM3256A CPLD. </P>
<B><U><P>Electrical Engineering Manager</B></U> for Park Scientific Instruments now TM Microscopes Div. of Veeco from August 94 managing two other engineers. Project manager on NanoLens microscope, inventor on a new scanner patent, active vibration isolation patent, designed 20 bit DAC high voltage piezo driver board.</P>
<B><U><P>Systems Engineer</B> for Park Scientific Instruments </U>designed most of the boards in the AutoProbe microscope. Inventor on AutoProbe patent. Designed a <U>Digital Signal Processor board</U> for the ISA bus, using a Motorola DSP56002 running at 40MHz with zero wait states. To simplify design I implemented all the host interface glue logic in one MACH210 chip. This DSP is used to run three servo loops that control the micro positioning of the scanning probe. This board acquires the image information in real time, buffers it and down loads it to the host computer. <U>Data acquisition board</U>, this board has four 16 bit ADCs and six 16 bit DACs with a 170KHz maximum sample rate. This board still has a low noise level even though it is placed inside of a PC.</P>
<B><U><P>Started my own business</B> No Bell Instruments</U> manufacturing accessories and software for Scanning Probe Microscopes. Designed the <U>Micro Tip</U> automatic tip etcher for Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STM). It is an electrochemical etch controller for etching a tungsten wire to a sharp point about 100 nanometers in diameter. Wrote NANO2PST a utility program for the Digital Instruments Nanoscope to convert their binary screen dumps to industry standard graphics formats PostScript and TIFF Oct. 90 to Aug. 91 </P>
<B><U><P>Systems Engineer</B> for Angstrom Technology Inc</U>., designed all critical Analog portions of their Scanning Tunneling Microscopes among these was their pre-amplifier capable of monitoring a 100 pico ampere tunneling signal. Designed the electronics for electrochemistry control. Redesigned all their mechanical designs for ease of production. Worked on trouble shooting the digital portion of their control computers, did installations, training, and applications. I also did much of the board assembly on the first units. 88 to 90</P>
<B><P>Fellowship</B> from NASA working on scanning tunneling microscopy research at the University of Akron. Built an STM for use in liquid Helium, controlled by a SUN workstation. August 87 to December 88</P>
<B><P>Taught Physics for Life Sciences Laboratory</B> from 83 to 87 and worked in the research labs during the summers and spare time. <B>Built my first STM 1986</B> for use in my thesis research controlled by an IBM AT. Worked on four different research projects while at the University of Akron.</P>
