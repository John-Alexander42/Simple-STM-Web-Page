		<P><U><B>Sr. Systems Engineer</B> </U><SPAN style="text-decoration: none">for
		Molecular Imaging Corp. now Agil</SPAN><SPAN style="text-decoration: none">ent
		Technologies. From October 2003. </SPAN>Redesigned much of the
		front end electronics to improve noise and bandwidth of the
		PicoPlus microscope. Redesigned the MAC/AAC mode controller to
		improve bandwidth and and reduce noise. The MAC1.2 is now the
		highest frequency AFM AC mode commercially available.</P>
		<P><B><U>Electrical Design Engineer</U></B> for KLA-Tencor From
		March 2000. I started in profilers working on advanced development
		projects developing electronics for a heterodyne laser
		interferometer. I was assigned to work on another advanced
		development project measuring Cu film thickness. We developed a
		microwave near field Probe to measure Cu thickness using eddy
		currents. We have got a patent on this technique(US006794886B1). I
		was next assigned to work on Quantox a Kelvin probe tool. I built a
		prototype using a Quartz tuning fork probe. This method was
		promising because no light was required to monitor the motion of
		the probe. I designed the Probe control board and Pre-amplifier for
		the new Quantox. The Probe Control Board has two dual channel
		lockin detectors, twelve 20 bit ADCs, two 24 bit DACs and an Altera
		EPM3256A CPLD.

		<P><B><U>Electrical Engineering Manager</U></B> for Park Scientific
		Instruments now TM Microscopes Div. of Veeco from August 94
		managing two other engineers. Project manager on NanoLens
		microscope, inventor on a new scanner patent, active vibration
		isolation patent, designed 20 bit DAC high voltage piezo driver
		board.</P>
		<P><U><B>Systems Engineer</B> for Park Scientific Instruments
		</U>designed most of the boards in the AutoProbe microscope.
		Inventor on AutoProbe patent. Designed a <U>Digital Signal
		Processor board</U> for the ISA bus, using a Motorola DSP56002
		running at 40MHz with zero wait states. To simplify design I
		implemented all the host interface glue logic in one MACH210 chip.
		This DSP is used to run three servo loops that control the micro
		positioning of the scanning probe. This board acquires the image
		information in real time, buffers it and down loads it to the host
		computer. <U>Data acquisition board</U>, this board has four 16 bit
		ADCs and six 16 bit DACs with a 170KHz maximum sample rate. This
		board still has a low noise level even though it is placed inside
		of a PC.</P>
		<P><U><B>Started my own business</B> No Bell Instruments</U>
		manufacturing accessories and software for Scanning Probe
		Microscopes. Designed the <U>Micro Tip</U> automatic tip etcher for
		Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STM). It is an electrochemical etch
		controller for etching a tungsten wire to a sharp point about 100
		nanometers in diameter. Wrote NANO2PST a utility program for the
		Digital Instruments Nanoscope to convert their binary screen dumps
		to industry standard graphics formats PostScript and TIFF Oct. 90
		to Aug. 91 
		</P>
		<P><U><B>Systems Engineer</B> for Angstrom Technology Inc</U>.,
		designed all critical Analog portions of their Scanning Tunneling
		Microscopes among these was their pre-amplifier capable of
		monitoring a 100 pico ampere tunneling signal. Designed the
		electronics for electrochemistry control. Redesigned all their
		mechanical designs for ease of production. Worked on trouble
		shooting the digital portion of their control computers, did
		installations, training, and applications. I also did much of the
		board assembly on the first units. 88 to 90</P>
		<P><B>Fellowship</B> from NASA working on scanning tunneling
		microscopy research at the University of Akron. Built an STM for
		use in liquid Helium, controlled by a SUN workstation. August 87 to
		December 88</P>
		<P><B>Taught Physics for Life Sciences Laboratory</B> from 83 to 87
		and worked in the research labs during the summers and spare time.
		<B>Built my first STM 1986</B> for use in my thesis research
		controlled by an IBM AT. Worked on four different research projects
		while at the University of Akron.</P>
